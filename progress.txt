hiii !!


progress that happened in our project 

any one can edit and add your contribution 

let me first describe what our project is all about .

our project was about giving college score based on reviews and rating ( rating are optional )
for the reviews we will be using nlp to find the sentimental score based on the reviews and we will be 
adding the rating with that to  make the scoring system more efficient 

# Dataset

we are using the dataset from kaggle which has users_name , college_name , rating in it 
we almost had 4000 users data in it which made us traing and testing easy for us , the problem we had 
in this dataset was , most of the reviews are positive which may cause our model to find it difficult to 
identify  negative reviews
